# Wound Care and Dressing Protocol

**Document Type:** Clinical Procedure
**Department:** Nursing
**Version:** 3.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Language:** English

## Purpose
To provide standardized guidelines for wound assessment, cleaning, and dressing to promote optimal healing and prevent infection.

## Types of Wounds Covered
- Surgical wounds
- Traumatic wounds
- Pressure ulcers (stages I-IV)
- Diabetic ulcers
- Venous/arterial ulcers
- Burns (first and second degree)

## General Principles
1. Maintain aseptic technique
2. Assess wound at each dressing change
3. Keep wound bed moist but surrounding skin dry
4. Protect periwound skin
5. Control exudate
6. Eliminate dead space
7. Monitor for signs of infection

## Equipment Required
- Sterile gloves
- Clean gloves
- Normal saline (0.9% NaCl)
- Sterile gauze
- Appropriate wound dressing
- Tape or securing device
- Sterile scissors/forceps (if needed)
- Waste disposal bag
- Documentation materials

## Wound Assessment (TIME Framework)

### T - Tissue
- **Healthy granulation**: Pink/red, moist, grainy appearance
- **Slough**: Yellow, tan, or white tissue (non-viable)
- **Eschar**: Black or brown necrotic tissue (requires debridement)
- **Epithelial**: Pink, shiny, regenerating tissue

### I - Infection/Inflammation
**Signs of infection:**
- Increased pain
- Erythema (redness) extending beyond wound edges
- Warmth
- Purulent drainage
- Foul odor
- Fever
- Increased white blood cell count

### M - Moisture Balance
- **Dry**: Add moisture-retentive dressing
- **Moist**: Ideal - maintain current management
- **Wet**: Use more absorbent dressing

### E - Edge
- **Advancing**: Epithelialization occurring
- **Non-advancing**: May need debridement or different treatment
- **Undermining/Tunneling**: Measure and document depth

## Dressing Change Procedure

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Review physician orders and wound care plan
2. Gather all supplies
3. Explain procedure to patient
4. Provide privacy
5. Position patient for comfort and access
6. Perform hand hygiene

### Step 2: Removal of Old Dressing
1. Put on clean gloves
2. Gently remove tape toward wound
3. Remove dressing carefully
   - If stuck, moisten with normal saline
   - Note drainage amount and characteristics
4. Dispose of dressing in appropriate waste bag
5. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene

### Step 3: Wound Cleaning
1. Don sterile gloves
2. Clean wound with normal saline
   - For clean wounds: clean from center outward
   - For contaminated wounds: clean from cleanest to dirtiest area
3. Pat dry surrounding skin with sterile gauze
4. Avoid antiseptics unless specifically ordered (can damage healing tissue)

### Step 4: Wound Measurement
Document the following:
- **Length**: Head to toe (cm)
- **Width**: Side to side (cm)
- **Depth**: Deepest point (cm)
- **Undermining**: Note location using clock method (12 o'clock = toward head)
- **Tunneling**: Measure depth and note location

### Step 5: Apply New Dressing
1. Select appropriate dressing based on wound type and exudate level
2. Apply dressing to cover wound completely
3. Extend 2-3 cm beyond wound edges
4. Secure with tape or retention device
5. Avoid circular wrapping on extremities (risk of constriction)
6. Date and initial dressing

### Step 6: Post-Procedure
1. Dispose of waste properly
2. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene
3. Position patient comfortably
4. Document procedure

## Dressing Selection Guide

| Wound Type | Exudate Level | Recommended Dressing |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Superficial, dry | Minimal | Hydrogel or transparent film |
| Superficial, moist | Light | Transparent film or thin hydrocolloid |
| Partial thickness | Moderate | Foam or hydrocolloid |
| Full thickness | Heavy | Foam or alginate |
| Infected | Variable | Antimicrobial (silver, iodine) |
| Necrotic tissue | Variable | Hydrogel (for autolytic debridement) |

## Frequency of Dressing Changes
- **Surgical wounds**: Every 24-48 hours initially, then per protocol
- **Clean wounds**: Every 3-7 days or when saturated
- **Infected wounds**: Daily or more frequently
- **Highly exudative wounds**: Daily or twice daily
- **Hydrocolloid dressings**: Every 3-7 days

## Red Flags - Notify Physician Immediately
- Signs of systemic infection (fever, chills)
- Rapidly spreading erythema
- Increasing pain not controlled by medication
- Foul-smelling drainage
- Excessive bleeding
- Wound dehiscence (separation)
- Necrotic tissue development
- No improvement after 2 weeks of treatment

## Pain Management
- Administer prescribed analgesics 30 minutes before dressing change
- Use gentle technique
- Consider lidocaine gel or spray for painful wounds
- Allow patient to participate in timing breaks during procedure

## Documentation Requirements
Record in patient chart:
- Date and time
- Wound location (anatomical)
- Wound measurements (L x W x D)
- Tissue type and percentage
- Exudate amount and character
- Periwound skin condition
- Signs of infection (if any)
- Dressing type applied
- Patient response to procedure
- Nurse signature

## Special Considerations

### Pressure Ulcer Prevention
- Reposition every 2 hours
- Use pressure-redistributing surfaces
- Keep skin clean and dry
- Optimize nutrition and hydration

### Diabetic Wound Care
- Monitor blood glucose control
- Assess vascular status
- Offload pressure from affected area
- Screen for infection regularly

## Education Points for Patient/Family
- Keep dressing clean and dry
- Report signs of infection immediately
- Maintain adequate nutrition and hydration
- Follow positioning/mobility restrictions
- Do not remove dressing between nursing visits
