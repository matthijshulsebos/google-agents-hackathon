# IV Insertion Protocol

**Document Type:** Clinical Procedure
**Department:** Nursing
**Version:** 2.1
**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Language:** English

## Purpose
This protocol outlines the standard procedure for peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter insertion to ensure patient safety and minimize complications.

## Indications
- Fluid resuscitation
- Medication administration
- Blood product transfusion
- Nutritional support

## Equipment Required
- IV catheter (appropriate gauge)
- Tourniquet
- Alcohol wipes (70% isopropyl alcohol)
- Chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine
- Sterile gloves
- Transparent dressing
- Tape
- Gauze pads
- Sharps container
- IV extension tubing

## Procedure Steps

### 1. Patient Preparation
- Verify patient identity using two identifiers
- Explain the procedure to the patient
- Obtain verbal consent
- Assess patient for allergies (latex, antiseptics)
- Review patient's vein condition and previous IV sites

### 2. Hand Hygiene and PPE
- Perform hand hygiene
- Don clean gloves
- Prepare sterile field

### 3. Site Selection
**Preferred sites (in order):**
1. Dorsal metacarpal veins
2. Cephalic vein (forearm)
3. Median antebrachial vein
4. Basilic vein

**Avoid:**
- Areas of infection, injury, or inflammation
- Sclerosed or thrombosed veins
- Arm on side of mastectomy
- Limb with arteriovenous fistula
- Areas of previous infiltration

### 4. Vein Preparation
- Apply tourniquet 4-6 inches above insertion site
- Do not leave tourniquet on for more than 2 minutes
- Palpate vein to assess suitability
- Ask patient to make a fist to distend veins
- Clean site with alcohol wipe in circular motion outward
- Allow to air dry completely (30 seconds)

### 5. Catheter Insertion
- Hold catheter at 15-30 degree angle with bevel up
- Warn patient of sharp stick
- Insert needle through skin into vein
- Look for flashback of blood in chamber
- Advance catheter 1-2mm further after flashback
- Lower angle and slide catheter forward while retracting needle
- Release tourniquet
- Apply pressure above catheter tip
- Remove needle completely and dispose in sharps container

### 6. Securing the Catheter
- Attach primed extension tubing or IV administration set
- Flush catheter with 3-5mL normal saline
- Observe for swelling or infiltration
- Apply transparent dressing over insertion site
- Document site, catheter gauge, and insertion details

### 7. Post-Insertion Assessment
- Assess site for signs of complications:
  - Redness
  - Swelling
  - Pain
  - Leakage
- Document in patient record
- Educate patient on signs to report

## Catheter Gauge Selection
| Gauge | Flow Rate | Indication |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| 14-16 | Very Fast | Trauma, rapid transfusion |
| 18 | Fast | Surgery, blood transfusion |
| 20 | Moderate | Most medications, fluids |
| 22-24 | Slow | Pediatrics, elderly, fragile veins |

## Complications to Monitor
- **Infiltration**: Fluid leaking into surrounding tissue
- **Phlebitis**: Inflammation of vein
- **Infection**: Local or systemic
- **Hematoma**: Bruising at site
- **Nerve injury**: Tingling, numbness
- **Air embolism**: Rare but serious

## Documentation Requirements
Record the following:
- Date and time of insertion
- Catheter gauge and length
- Number of attempts
- Site location (anatomical description)
- Patient response
- Complications encountered
- Nurse signature and credentials

## Site Maintenance
- Assess site every 4 hours
- Change dressing every 7 days or when soiled
- Replace catheter every 72-96 hours per policy
- Flush with saline before and after medication
