# Help/Onboarding Agent Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All 6 steps have been successfully implemented to add a Help/Onboarding Agent to the Hospital Multi-Agent Information Retrieval System.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Help Agent Class** (`agents/help_agent.py`)
- ✅ Full HelpAgent class with multilingual support (EN, ES, FR, DE)
- ✅ Language detection for all 4 supported languages
- ✅ User role detection (nurse, employee, pharmacist)
- ✅ Static `is_help_query()` method for Priority 1 detection
- ✅ Template-based responses for simple queries (fast)
- ✅ Gemini-powered responses for complex queries
- ✅ Does NOT use RAG pipeline (no document search needed)

**Key Features:**
- Detects help queries with high accuracy
- Provides role-specific guidance and examples
- Never answers domain questions directly
- Redirects users to ask their actual questions

### 2. **Help Agent Prompts** (`agents/prompts/help_prompts.py`)
- ✅ Comprehensive system instruction
- ✅ Role-specific example questions for each agent type
- ✅ Multilingual templates for all 4 languages
- ✅ Helper functions for formatting responses

**Supported Roles:**
- Nurse (EN/ES)
- Employee/HR (EN/FR)
- Pharmacist (EN/DE)
- General (all languages)

### 3. **Orchestrator Updates** (`orchestrator.py`)
- ✅ Help Agent initialization (no datastore required)
- ✅ **Priority 1 Routing** - Help queries checked FIRST
- ✅ **Priority 2 Routing** - Domain queries (nursing, hr, pharmacy)
- ✅ Updated agent routing map to include help agent
- ✅ Updated health check to handle help agent (no RAG)
- ✅ Updated get_agent_info() with help agent details

**Routing Logic:**
```python
# PRIORITY 1: Check for help queries FIRST
if HelpAgent.is_help_query(query):
    route to Help Agent

# PRIORITY 2: Route to domain agents
else:
    classify and route to nursing/hr/pharmacy
```

### 4. **Query Classifier Updates** (`utils/query_classifier.py`)
- ✅ Added "help" category to classification prompt
- ✅ Updated valid categories list to include "help"
- ✅ Added examples distinguishing help vs domain queries
- ✅ Clear guidance on "help" vs domain classification

**Classification Categories:**
1. `help` - Questions about using the system
2. `nursing` - Medical procedures and protocols
3. `hr` - Policies and benefits
4. `pharmacy` - Medication inventory

### 5. **Configuration** (`config.py`)
- ✅ No changes needed (help agent doesn't require datastore)

### 6. **Test Suite** (`tests/test_help_agent.py`)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for help query detection
- ✅ Tests for all 4 languages (EN, ES, FR, DE)
- ✅ Tests ensuring domain queries are NOT detected as help
- ✅ Language detection tests
- ✅ User role detection tests
- ✅ Integration tests with orchestrator
- ✅ Example test scenarios for manual verification

## 🎯 Key Functionality

### Help Query Detection

**Detected as HELP queries:**
- ✅ "How do I use this system?"
- ✅ "What can I ask?"
- ✅ "Can I check pharmacy inventory here?"
- ✅ "How does this tool work?"
- ✅ "Guide me"
- ✅ "¿Cómo usar este sistema?"
- ✅ "Comment utiliser?"
- ✅ "Wie benutze ich?"

**NOT detected as help (domain queries):**
- ✅ "How do I insert an IV?" → Routes to Nursing Agent
- ✅ "How many vacation days?" → Routes to HR Agent
- ✅ "Is ibuprofen in stock?" → Routes to Pharmacy Agent

### Detection Algorithm

The system uses two detection patterns:

1. **Explicit help patterns:**
   - "how to use", "what can i ask", "help me", etc.

2. **Question + System reference:**
   - Question word ("how", "what", "can") + System reference ("system", "tool", "chat")

---

## 🧪 Verification Tests

### Detection Logic Tests - ✅ ALL PASSED

```
✓ PASS - Help query: "How do I use this system?"
✓ PASS - Help query: "What can I ask?"
✓ PASS - Help + system ref: "Can I check pharmacy inventory here?"
✓ PASS - Domain - nursing: "How do I insert an IV?"
✓ PASS - Domain - HR: "How many vacation days?"
✓ PASS - Domain - pharmacy: "Is ibuprofen in stock?"
✓ PASS - Help + system ref: "What is this system?"

Results: 7 passed, 0 failed
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Example Flow 1: Help Query

```
User: "Can I check pharmacy inventory in this chat?"
  ↓
Orchestrator: Priority 1 check
  ↓
HelpAgent.is_help_query() → TRUE
  ↓
Routes to: Help Agent
  ↓
Response:
  "Yes! You can check medication inventory here.

   Example questions:
   - Is ibuprofen 400mg in stock?
   - Do we have acetaminophen available?
   - What antibiotics are in inventory?

   What medication would you like to know about?"
```

### Example Flow 2: Domain Query

```
User: "Is ibuprofen in stock?"
  ↓
Orchestrator: Priority 1 check
  ↓
HelpAgent.is_help_query() → FALSE
  ↓
Priority 2: Query classification
  ↓
Routes to: Pharmacy Agent
  ↓
Response: [Actual inventory information with citations]
```

## 🎨 Agent Information

The system now has **4 agents** (was 3):

### Priority 1 Agent:
- **Help Agent**
  - Languages: EN, ES, FR, DE
  - Purpose: System guidance and onboarding
  - Method: Gemini Direct (no RAG)
  - Handles: "How to use" queries

### Priority 2 Agents:
- **Nursing Agent**
  - Languages: EN, ES
  - Purpose: Medical procedures and protocols
  - Method: RAG Pipeline with Vertex AI Search

- **HR Agent**
  - Languages: EN, FR
  - Purpose: Policies and benefits
  - Method: RAG Pipeline with Vertex AI Search

- **Pharmacy Agent**
  - Languages: EN, DE
  - Purpose: Medication inventory
  - Method: RAG Pipeline with Vertex AI Search

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Python API:

```python
from orchestrator import HospitalOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orch = HospitalOrchestrator()

# Help query - auto-routes to Help Agent
result = orch.process_query("How do I use this as a nurse?")
print(result['answer'])
# Output: Guidance with nursing examples

# Domain query - routes to Nursing Agent
result = orch.process_query("How do I insert an IV?")
print(result['answer'])
# Output: Actual IV insertion protocol
```

### REST API (if using api.py):

```bash
# Help query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What can I ask this system?"}'

# Domain query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Is ibuprofen in stock?"}'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Help agent not being called

**Check:**
1. Verify `HelpAgent.is_help_query()` returns True for your query
2. Check orchestrator initialization includes help_agent
3. Ensure no agent_override parameter is set

### Issue: Domain questions going to help agent

**Fix:**
- Review detection patterns in `help_agent.py`
- Ensure query doesn't contain system reference words
- Test with `HelpAgent.is_help_query(your_query)`
