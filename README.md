It's 3 AM in the cardiology ward. A newly rotated nurse needs to verify the hospital's protocol for administering high-dose anticoagulation therapy to a post-operative patient. The information exists somewhere. She checks the SharePoint site her supervisor mentioned during onboarding. Nothing under "Cardiology Protocols." She tries the shared drive. There are three folders labeled "Protocols," each containing dozens of PDFs. She searches her email for that message from last month. Was it the updated version or the draft?

Twenty minutes later, after checking three different locations and skimming through outdated policy documents, she finds what she believes is the current protocol: a PDF dated six months ago. But is it the latest version? She can't be certain. Meanwhile, her patient is waiting, and four other tasks demand her attention.

The process has not been done yet! Does she have actually the medicine that doctor prescribed? What is the precedure to check medication in the inventory of pharmacy? She knows that there was some information about checking medications in the onboarding document. Where is the onboarding document? Nerve-wrancking...

Of course, it is a hypothetical situation, yet similar scenarios repeat themselves thousands of times daily across hospitals worldwide. The problem isn't a lack of information. Modern hospitals are drowning in policies, procedures, protocols, and guidelines. The problem is **retrieval**: getting the right information to the right person at the right time, in a format they can act upon.

But here's what makes this particularly interesting: we're not talking about patient data retrieval. We're talking about institutional knowledge. The policies, standard operating procedures, clinical guidelines, HR regulations, and facility protocols that every staff member, from physicians to logistics coordinators, needs to do their job effectively. And unlike patient data, this information doesn't have the same GDPR or HIPAA constraints, making it a good candidate for AI-powered solutions.

In this project, we design a multi-agent information retrieval system to save hundreds of hours of healthcare workers. Let's dive in!!!


A sophisticated multi-agent system built with Google ADK (Application Development Kit) and Vertex AI Search that intelligently routes queries to specialized AI agents for hospital staff. The system includes a **Help/Onboarding Agent** (Priority 1) that guides new users on how to use the system before routing to domain experts.

## 🏗️ System Components

The system consists of two main components:

### 1. 🔧 [Agent API](./agent-api/)
**Backend Multi-Agent System**

The core intelligence layer featuring:
- 🆘 Help/Onboarding Agent (Priority 1)
- 🏥 Nursing Agent (Medical procedures - EN/ES)
- 💼 HR Agent (Policies & benefits - EN/FR)
- 💊 Pharmacy Agent (Medication inventory - EN/DE)
- 🎯 Intelligent orchestrator with 2-tier priority routing
- 🔍 Vertex AI Search integration
- 📚 Document grounding with citations

### 2. 🖥️ [Agent UI](./agent-ui/)
**Frontend User Interface**

User-friendly interface for healthcare workers:
- 💬 Chat interface for queries
- 🎨 Role-based access (Nurse/Employee/Pharmacist)
- 🌐 Multilingual support
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🔄 Real-time responses
